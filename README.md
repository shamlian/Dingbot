# dingbot
The code that runs [Dingbot](http://shamlian.net/projects/bellchoir/), my [toy player piano](http://shamlian.net/projects/toypiano/), and [Xylobot](http://shamlian.net/projects/xylo/).

The code is pretty quick and nasty; I'm hoping that public shame will be enough motivation to whip it into shape.

Code should work just fine in WINAVR, but that's deprecated. To install tools on a modern Debian install,
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude
make
